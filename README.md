# velocorner.com
The web application provides metrics for cycling (or for other kind of sports) activities, trail descriptions, biking videos.
The metrics page compares yearly aggregated data, such as distance, hours ridden, elevation gained and shows year to date series as well.
The yearly data is also presented as a heatmap, so it is easy to compare the efforts for a given period of the year.
Currently I'm using [Strava](http://www.strava.com) and [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com/) to track my activities,
the data feed is collected via the [Strava API](https://developers.strava.com/docs/reference/).

The project is also used to experiment with the technologies.
